# Hepatitis Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on diagnosing **Hepatitis Disease** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a patient has Hepatitis based on medical attributes. The model was trained and evaluated using various machine learning algorithms, achieving an accuracy of **92%**.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains patient records with multiple medical attributes.
- Features include blood test results, liver function indicators, and other relevant health parameters.
- The target variable indicates whether a patient has Hepatitis or not.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data processing
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and engineering
   - Data normalization
2. **Model Training**
   - Implemented various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy: **92%**
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-score analysis
   - Confusion Matrix for performance assessment

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved **92% accuracy**.
- Feature importance analysis revealed the most significant medical indicators.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hepatitis-diagnosis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
